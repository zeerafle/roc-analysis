# ROC Analysis Project Instructions

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation, as well as when I face error. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

This project using slidev for creating presentation. For visualization, Plot (@observablehq/plot) are used.
